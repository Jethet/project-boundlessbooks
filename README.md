## BoundlessBooks app

*under construction*

For some time, I have been searching for a way to keep an inventory of my books. A few times, I bought a book and it turned out I already had the book but I forgot that I had it, or sometimes I had it in another language.

I tried a few library apps but so far, nothing worked the way I wanted it: simple. Just author, title and language.

The idea is to create a simple app that saves information about the books I own in a database. Ideally, it works by scanning the ISBN code but that may be too ambitious. The **MVP** is as follows:  

* the user can create a book entry
* the user can save books in a database
* the user can edit a book entry
* the user can delete a book entry
* the user can get an overview of the books
* the user can search for a book and view the results on the screen
* the user can search for an author and view the results on the screen

In the next stage of building the BoundlessBooks app, the goal is to add functionality:  
* the user can create an account
* the user can create a profile
* the user can log in and log out

Going for the ambitious level, it would be great to add the functionality of scanning the ISBN code of books and adding (part of) that information to the database. Dream on ... or maybe?
